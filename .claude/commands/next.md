description: Finish up and start the next crank
---

Prepare for the next crank cycle:

1. If `.thicket/tickets.jsonl` has uncommitted changes, commit it with message "chore: update tickets" and push.
2. Switch to `main` branch and pull latest.
3. Clear conversation context with `/clear`.
4. Run the `/crank` command.
